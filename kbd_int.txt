Pushing Ctrl-F in REPL causes a safe-boot
which is permanent until the reset button is pressed or machine.reset() is called.

Calling micropython.kbd_intr(-1) disables this special behavior of both Ctrl-F and Ctr-C, again until restart.
You can call kbd_int() with two arguments.
Then the second will set the soft-reset char, like
kbd_intr(3, -1) will disable Ctrl-F, but only until the REPL prompt comes back.
